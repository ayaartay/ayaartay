This is Assignment #1 for Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. 

The course is taught using Matlab and Octave and the assignments are expected to be completed using those programs. However, as I am using Python as my primary programming language, I have decided to do the exercises in Python.    

In this assignment I run simple linear regression with one variable using gradient descent. A restaurant chain has trucks in various cities and and wants to determine the truck profit function given population of a city. The chain already has data for profits (column 2) and city populations (column 1), which is given in the file ex1data1.txt.
