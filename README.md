In this assignment I run linear regression with one variable (population) to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. The file ex1data1.txt (available under week 2's assignment material) contains the dataset for our linear regression exercise. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
